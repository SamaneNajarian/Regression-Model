Car Price Prediction Project

Author: Samane Najarian
Language: R
Dataset: Used cars specifications (Price, Age, KM, FuelType, HP, MetColor, Automatic, CC, Doors, Weight)

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting car prices using a dataset of 1,325 used cars. The dataset includes various features such as age, mileage (KM), fuel type, horsepower, metallic color, transmission type, engine size (CC), number of doors, and weight.

The main objective is to build regression models to predict car prices based on these features and analyze their performance.

⚡ Key Findings

Car price decreases significantly with age and mileage.

Petrol cars tend to have slightly higher prices than Diesel or CNG cars.

Weight and horsepower positively affect car price.

Quadratic regression improves the fit over linear regression with mileage.
